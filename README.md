# Get That Table

## Project Description

This repository serves as the culmination of my work for the "Human-Computer Interaction" course at Bialystok University of Technology. Within this repository, you will find the code, documentation, and resources related to my project.  

## About the Project

This project houses my restaurant reservation application, developed as part of a course assignment. The project encompasses two phases:

### Phase 1: Text-Based Reservation System

In the initial phase, the task was to create an application that operates in a text-based mode. I chose to develop a restaurant reservation system that allows users to make reservations at their favorite eateries. The application's primary objective in this phase was to provide a seamless and user-friendly reservation experience within a command-line environment.

### Phase 2: Graphical User Interface (GUI) Integration

The second phase of the project challenged students to transition the text-based reservation system into a graphical user interface (GUI). While maintaining the same core reservation logic, I transformed the presentation layer from text-based to graphical. This phase allowed me to explore GUI design and enhance the user experience, building upon the foundation established in Phase 1.

## Features

- **Text-Based Phase:**
  - User-friendly text-based reservation system.
  - Reservation management for multiple restaurants.
  - Real-time availability updates.

- **GUI Phase:**
  - Intuitive graphical user interface.
  - Seamless transition from text-based reservations.
  - Enhanced visual representation of restaurant options.
  - Improved user interaction and feedback.

## Getting Started

To get started with our restaurant reservation application:

- **Text-Based Phase:** I used Dart to develop the reservation system. You can run the application using Dart's command-line tools or run .exe file.
- **GUI Phase:** For the GUI phase, I utilized Flutter, a versatile framework that allows the development of applications for various platforms. However, I focused on the Android platform. The applications can be launched by downloading the .apk file.
